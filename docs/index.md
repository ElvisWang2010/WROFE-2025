# WRO Future Engineers Getting Started

Starting from the 2020 season [World Robot Olympiad](https://wro-association.org/association/introduction){target=_blank} is expanding the set of competitions offered for students around the world by adding a new competition: "Future Engineers".

The WRO Future Engineers category is a self driving car competition. Students ages 14 to 19 will design a model car, equip it with electromechanical components, and program it so it will be able to autonomously drive on a track and avoid obstacles.

More details about the competition can be found at [the official site of WRO Association](https://wro-association.org/competition/new-competition-formats/future-engineers){target=_blank}.

The Future Engineers challenge does not limit the students to any specific hardware or programming language, which is why working with electromechanical components (motors and sensors) and/or with a micro controller will be challenging. Moreover, the most effective way to make a car fully autonomous is to use a camera and computer vision algorithms.  This is also a completely new direction in WRO competition, never used before. The goal of this site is to provide materials for an initial understanding of how the self-driving vehicle can be assembled and how it can be programmed to achieve results in the competition.

This site covers the following topics:

  * [Chassis](p01-chassis.md) -- how to assemble a vehicle
  * [Electromechanical components](p02-electronics.md) -- which electromechanical components and controllers can be used and how to connect them to each other
  * [Basics of SBM and SBC programming](p03-programming.md) -- materials describing different aspects of programming Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards
  * [Computer vision](p04-cv.md) -- a method that can be used to implement an algorithm to solve the challenge
  * [Miscellaneous](p05-misc.md) -- extra materials that do not fit in other sections
  * [Robot sets](p06-robot-sets.md) -- robot sets that can be used for a quick start

Enjoy, as you acquire new knowledge and skills!
