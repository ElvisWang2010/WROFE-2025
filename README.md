# Hardware Design




### Chassis 


For our build, we selected the **ACXWA CD chassis**, a non-prebuilt frame originally crafted with a modular design to provide adjustable lengths between 1/28 and 1/24 scale. During development, we redesigned the component connecting the front and rear sections to improve structural stability. This modification locked the chassis into a fixed 1/24 scale (16.2 cm). While adjustable lengths provide flexibility, they introduce structural weakness. Our fixed build removes this weak point, creating a rigid, non-sliding frame.

### Notable Features / Design Advantages

- **Cost-effective:** At only **$27 CAD**, the chassis allowed us to remain within budget, compared to typical pre-built chassis costing between **$50 and $100+**.
- **Motor stand included:** This reduced assembly time and ensured accurate motor alignment, minimizing drivetrain losses and gear misalignment.
- **High steering range:** Tested front wheels pivoted significantly, enabling tight turns with less steering input‚Äîideal for technical track layouts.
- **Compact form factor:** The fixed 1/24 scale size facilitated a streamlined electronics layout (ESC, battery), reducing clutter and improving airflow for cooling.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Chassis Limitations  

Despite the benefits, the chassis presented several challenges that impacted performance and assembly:  

- **Tire traction:** The stock plastic tires offered almost no grip, which we noticed immediately during testing. On smooth surfaces like the game map, this resulted in uncontrolled wheelspin, unstable acceleration, and extended braking distances.
- **Steering imbalance:** We also observed that the front wheels did not pivot evenly, creating unbalanced turning angles. The turning was unpredicable and when navigating precise maneuvers, uneven steering made the car to control consistantly.

## ‚úÖ How We Overcame These Limitations  

- **Improved traction:** We replaced stock plastic tires with **rubber-coated wheels**. This simple change was crucial, acceleration was more controlled and the robot futhered the reliability of the car.
- **Balanced steering:** Designed and **3D-printed a custom steering system**, succeeding our previous unequal one.

We chose the <strong>Gens Ace 1300mAh 7.4V LiPo</strong> because it offers an ideal balance of power, size, and weight for a small RC car. It has a <strong>45C continuous discharge rate</strong>, and the battery supplies up to <strong>58.5A (1300mAh √ó 45C)</strong>, meeting up to our power demands. The <strong>1300mAh capacity</strong> gives the car a solid runtime and at only <strong>90g</strong>, the battery minimizes added weight to the chassis, helping the car move quicker. Finally, its <strong>compact dimensions (70.87 √ó 35.24 √ó 14.5mm)</strong> allow it to fit securely in the car‚Äôs battery compartment, making it both an efficient and reliable power source for our design.

### Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)

The ESC is a key component that regulates how the motor receives power. It:  
- Controls the motor's **speed**  
- Manages **direction**  
- Ensures safe delivery of **voltage and current** to the motor

This ESC was selected for its excellent compatibility with our power system, supporting **2S‚Äì3S LiPo batteries** to perfectly match our **7.4V (2S) Gens Ace battery**. Its current handling‚Äî**30A continuous** and 
**50A burst**‚Äîgreatly exceeds our motor‚Äôs maximum draw of ~10A.  

The ESC features a strong, **switchable 5V/6.5V 2.5A BEC**, allowing servo our to be powered directly without an external BEC, saving both **weight** and **internal chassis space**.  
At just **3.7g**, the ESC is extremely lightweight, blending well into the chassis.

## Design
Most of the car was 3D printed or replaced, for example, the turning mechanism and motor mechanism from either of poor quality or not durable. The board underneath the car was not 3D printed, as it was made from carbon fiber and is more durable and lighter compared to printed part.

## Motor


## Power Resource Management


## Software
### Python 3.0
Python 3 is the core programming language used to build and run the autonomous car logic. Its simplicity, readability, and massive library pool make it ideal for controlling hardware like the Raspberry Pi. For robotics, Python makes it easy to interface with sensors and actuators, process images, and manage logic. However, Python is slower than compiled languages like C++, and because it‚Äôs dynamically typed, certain bugs may only appear at runtime if not carefully tested.

### Picamera2
Picamera2 is a library used to interface with the Raspberry Pi's camera module. It allows the robot to capture real-time photos and videos, which are critical for analyzing the robot environment. It provides full control over resolution, frame rate, and pixel format to effectively work in tandem with OpenCV.

### OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used to process camera frames, apply thresholding, and detect contours within specified regions of interests (ROIs). This data is used to determine the robots orientation and distance relative to walls to guide its movement throughout the course.

### ROS_ROBOT_CONTROLLER_SDK
This custom Python SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by HiWonder is responsible for controlling robot hardware, including steering servos, throttle motors, and RGB LEDs. It turns low-level control into simple methods, allowing the main code to remain clean.

### RPI.GPIO
The RPi.GPIO library is used to read inputs from the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs GPIO pins, particularly for detecting button presses.

## Complete Construction Manual


The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles. Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car, equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections.

More details about the competition can be found on [the official site of WRO Association](https://wro-association.org/competition/new-competition-formats/future-engineers).
