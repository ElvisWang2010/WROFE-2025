The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles. Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car, equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections.

More details about the competition can be found on [the official site of WRO Association](https://wro-association.org/competition/new-competition-formats/future-engineers).

The materials are intended to be build with the [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site generator.

The example of the site is accessible by https://world-robot-olympiad-association.github.io/future-engineers-gs/.
